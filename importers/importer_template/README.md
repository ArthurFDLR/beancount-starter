# Beancount Importer Template

This is a template for a Beancount importer. It is meant to be used as a starting point for creating your own importer of bank statements. It is not meant to be used as is.

Before implementing your own importer, you should check if there is already an existing importer for your bank. You can find a list of community maintained importers in [`awesome-beancount`](https://awesome-beancount.com/#importers).
